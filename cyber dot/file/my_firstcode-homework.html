		<p><h3>About CSE</h3></p>
		<p><ins>Computer science and engineering (CSE)</ins> is an academic program at many universities which comprises approaches of computer science and computer engineering. There is no clear division in computing between science and engineering, just like in the field of materials science and engineering. However, <del>some classes are historically</del> more related to computer science (e.g. data structures and algorithms), and other to computer engineering (e.g. computer architecture). <u>CSE is also a term often used in Europe</u> to translate the name of technical or engineering informatics academic programs. It is offered in both undergraduate as well postgraduate with specializations.</p>
