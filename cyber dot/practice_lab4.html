			This article is about darknet websites. For the part of the Internet not accessible by traditional web search engines, see Deep web. For the comic book storyline, see Dark Web (Marvel Comics).
			The dark web is the World Wide Web content that exists on darknets: overlay networks that use the Internet but require specific software, configurations, or authorization to access.[1][2][3][4] Through the dark web, private computer networks can communicate and conduct business anonymously without divulging identifying information, such as a user's location.[5][6] The dark web forms a small part of the deep web, the part of the web not indexed by web search engines, although sometimes the term deep web is mistakenly used to refer specifically to the dark web.[7][2][8]

			The darknets which constitute the dark web include small, friend-to-friend networks, as well as large, popular networks such as Tor, Freenet, I2P, and Riffle operated by public organizations and individuals.[6] Users of the dark web refer to the regular web as Clearnet due to its unencrypted nature.[9] The Tor dark web or onionland[10] uses the traffic anonymization technique of onion routing under the network's top-level domain suffix .onion.

			The dark web has often been confused with the deep web, the parts of the web not indexed (searchable) by search engines. The term dark web first emerged in 2009; however, it is unknown when the actual dark web first emerged.[11] Many internet users only use the surface web, data that can be accessed by a typical web browser.[12] The dark web forms a small part of the deep web, but requires custom software in order to access its content. This confusion dates back to at least 2009.[13] Since then, especially in reporting on Silk Road, the two terms have often been conflated,[14] despite recommendations that they should be distinguished.[1][7]
